#### My language uses variant forms of some Myanmar characters. How do I type these using the Padauk font?

See [Using Font Features](https://software.sil.org/fonts/features/).

#### Are there Unicode issues for Myanmar that I should be aware of?

There is a [Myanmar Scripts and Languages](http://www.unicode.org/faq/myanmar.html) FAQ available on the Unicode website.

#### Why does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and dialogs?

Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold. To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using the application’s UI controls such as a “B” button. See our [Font Help Guide on Axis-Based Font Families](https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/) for more information.

#### Why do I sometimes get a fake Bold?

If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as Medium), and then use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications will make a “fake” Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the font (Bold, ExtraBold). This is because only Regular has an associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical limitation with some apps and OSes. If you are using a weight other than Regular for text and want to make a word or phrase stand out, you will need to select the text and apply one of the heavier weights manually. See our [Font Help Guide on Axis-Based Font Families](https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/) for more information.

#### Where is the heavier-weight Book family?

Padauk Book is an alternate font family that is slightly heavier overall. Padauk Book Regular is the same weight as Padauk Medium. This family is no longer included in the main Padauk package—it is available as a [separate download package](https://software.sil.org/padauk/download/).
