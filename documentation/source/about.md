## About this project

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for languages and writing systems that use the Myanmar (Burmese) script. It supports the complete range of Unicode characters for the script.

## Future plans

The project will be renamed and a range of weights will be provided (Light to Bold).
The regular and bold weights of the new project will be close to (maybe the same) as
the regular and bold weights of Padauk Book.

Please send us your requests using the [form on the font website](https://software.sil.org/padauk/about/contact/). If you are interested in helping us make the fonts better see the [Developer](developer.md) page.
