    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>These fonts are supported by all major operating systems (macOS,
    Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that
    support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the fonts by decompressing the .zip archive and
    installing the fonts using the standard font installation process
    for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional
    tips see the help page on <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font
    installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and
    character set support</h2>
    <p>These fonts do not include keyboards or other software for
    entering text. To type the symbols in these fonts use the
    keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility.
    SIL’s <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> provides keyboards
    for over 2000 languages and works on all major desktop and mobile
    platforms. One keyboard for for this font is the <a
    href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_myanmar_my3">Keyman Myanmar3
    (SIL) keyboard</a>. For information on other keyboarding options see
    the overview at <a
    href="https://writingsystems.info/topics/input/keyboards-and-tools/">Keyboard
    and Tools (Writing Systems Technical Resources)</a>.</p>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details
    of the Unicode characters supported by these fonts.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application
    support</h2>
    <p>Complex typographic issues such as the placement of combining
    marks or the formation of conjuncts and ligatures are handled by the
    font, provided you are running an application that provides an
    adequate level of support for OpenType shaping.</p>
    <p>These fonts also include extensive OpenType features for
    character alternates and language-specific preferences. For
    information on the specific features available in these fonts see <a
    href="features.html">Font features</a>.</p>
    <p>If special font features are to be activated the application will
    need to provide a way to turn on the feature or choose the feature
    setting. Details of current application support, and specific
    techniques for activating features, are on the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/features">Using Font
    Features</a> help page.</p>
    <p>Although the current fonts support only OpenType, previous
    versions provided support for Graphite technologies. Graphite was
    supported through version 5.100. These older versions remain
    available from our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/padauk/download/previous-versions">Previous
    Versions archive</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of these fonts (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are
    available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a
    web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS
    demo page is also included. For more information on the options and
    techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on
    Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion">Text conversion</h2>
    <p>These fonts are encoded according to <a
    href="https://unicode.org">The Unicode Standard</a>. If you have
    text that uses a legacy, non-Unicode encoding there are tools that
    can help you convert that text for use with Unicode fonts. See <a
    href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/xlzd6n5aqt">Introduction to
    Text Conversion and Transliteration</a>.</p>
