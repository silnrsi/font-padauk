    id="my-language-uses-variant-forms-of-some-myanmar-characters.-how-do-i-type-these-using-the-padauk-font">My
    language uses variant forms of some Myanmar characters. How do I
    type these using the Padauk font?</h4>
    <p>See <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/features/">Using Font
    Features</a>.</p>
    <h4
    id="are-there-unicode-issues-for-myanmar-that-i-should-be-aware-of">Are
    there Unicode issues for Myanmar that I should be aware of?</h4>
    <p>There is a <a
    href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/myanmar.html">Myanmar Scripts and
    Languages</a> FAQ available on the Unicode website.</p>
    <h4
    id="why-does-my-application-not-show-the-bold-weight-in-font-menus-and-dialogs">Why
    does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and
    dialogs?</h4>
    <p>Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold.
    To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using
    the application’s UI controls such as a “B” button. See our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Font Help
    Guide on Axis-Based Font Families</a> for more information.</p>
    <h4 id="why-do-i-sometimes-get-a-fake-bold">Why do I sometimes get a
    fake Bold?</h4>
    <p>If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as Medium), and
    then use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications
    will make a “fake” Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the
    font (Bold, ExtraBold). This is because only Regular has an
    associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical limitation with
    some apps and OSes. If you are using a weight other than Regular for
    text and want to make a word or phrase stand out, you will need to
    select the text and apply one of the heavier weights manually. See
    our <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Font
    Help Guide on Axis-Based Font Families</a> for more information.</p>
    <h4 id="where-is-the-heavier-weight-book-family">Where is the
    heavier-weight Book family?</h4>
    <p>Padauk Book is an alternate font family that is slightly heavier
    overall. Padauk Book Regular is the same weight as Padauk Medium.
    This family is no longer included in the main Padauk package—it is
    available as a <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/padauk/download/">separate download
    package</a>.</p>
